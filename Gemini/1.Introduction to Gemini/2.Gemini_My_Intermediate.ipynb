      "**Instructions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Marinate the Mushrooms:** In a bowl, combine the sliced mushrooms with ginger-garlic paste, yogurt, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, coriander powder, cumin powder, and salt. Mix well and let it marinate for at least 15 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Sauté Aromatics:** Heat ghee or oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté until golden brown. Add the crushed cloves, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, bay leaves, and star anise (if using). Sauté for another minute until fragrant.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Add Tomatoes and Chili:** Add the chopped tomatoes and green chili (if using) to the pot. Cook until the tomatoes soften and release their juices (about 5-7 minutes).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cook the Mushrooms:** Add the marinated mushrooms to the pot and cook until they are tender and have released their moisture (about 8-10 minutes).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Layer the Rice:** Add the soaked and drained basmati rice to the pot. Stir gently to combine with the mushroom mixture. Pour in the vegetable broth (or water) and add salt to taste. Bring to a boil.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Simmer and Steam:** Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot tightly, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through and the liquid is absorbed.  Do not stir during this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Garnish and Rest:**  Once cooked, gently fluff the rice with a fork. Stir in the saffron milk (if using) and chopped cilantro. Cover the pot and let it rest for 5-10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Serve:** Serve hot, garnished with extra cilantro.  You can serve it with raita (yogurt dip) or a side salad.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tips and Variations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* For a richer flavor, you can add a layer of fried onions on top before steaming the rice.\n",
      "* You can substitute other vegetables like peas, carrots, or potatoes.\n",
      "* If you prefer a spicier briyani, add more green chilies or chili powder.\n",
      "* To make it a meat briyani, add cooked and shredded chicken or lamb along with the mushrooms. Adjust cooking time accordingly.\n",
